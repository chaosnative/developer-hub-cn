Harness environment represents your deployment infrastructures such as Dev, QA, Stage, Production, etc.
- It helps isolate the various environments that your engineering, product owners, QA, and automation teams use under a single Harness project. 
- This allows for better segregation of mission-critical infrastructures with several attached dependencies from dev and staging infrastructures for their safety. 

Multiple chaos infrastructures can be added as part of an environment, as part of HCE.
