Enterprise Chaos Hub comes out of the box with Harness Chaos Engineering, which provides a set of faults and experiment templates. These faults belong to different categories, such as:
- Kubernetes
    - Pods
    - Nodes
- AWS
- VMware
- Azure
- GCP

A variety of experiment templates are available as part of the Enterprise Chaos Hub, which uses faults from the above categories to create a number of chaos experiments for many failure scenarios, such as:
- AWS EC2 HTTP Latency
- K8s Node IO Stress
- VMware Network Latency
- Azure Web App Stop
