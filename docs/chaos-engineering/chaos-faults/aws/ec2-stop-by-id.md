title: EC2 Stop By ID
---

## Introduction

- It causes stopping of an EC2 instance using the provided instance ID or list of instance IDs before bringing it back to running state after the specified chaos duration.
- It helps to check the performance of the application/process running on the EC2 instance.
- When the `MANAGED_NODEGROUP` is enabled then the experiment will not try to start the instance post chaos instead it will check of the addition of the new node instance to the cluster.

## Uses

</details>

## Prerequisites

:::info

- Ensure that Kubernetes Version >= 1.17

**AWS EC2 Access Requirement:**

- Ensure that you have sufficient AWS access to stop and start an EC2 instance.
- Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the AWS access configuration(key) in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A sample secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  cloud_config.yml: |-
    # Add the cloud AWS credentials respectively
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

- If you change the secret key name (from `cloud_config.yml`) please also update the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` ENV value on `experiment.yaml`with the same name.

### WARNING

If the target EC2 instance is a part of a self-managed nodegroup then make sure to drain the target node if any application is running on it and also ensure to cordon the target node before running the experiment so that the experiment pods do not schedule on it.

## Default Validations

:::info

- EC2 instance should be in healthy state.

## Experiment Examples

### Common and AWS specific Tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-experiments) and [AWS specific tunable](./aws-experiments-tunables) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and aws specific Tunables.

### Stop Instances By ID

It contains comma separated list of instances IDs subjected to ec2 stop chaos. It can be tuned via `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/ec2-stop-by-id/instance-id.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains the instance id, to be terminated/stopped
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: ec2-terminate-by-id
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # id of the ec2 instance
        - name: EC2_INSTANCE_ID
          value: 'instance-1'
        # region for the ec2 instance
        - name: REGION
          value: 'us-east-1'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```
