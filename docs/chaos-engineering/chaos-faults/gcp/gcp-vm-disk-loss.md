title: GCP VM Disk Loss
---

## Introduction

- It causes chaos to disrupt state of GCP persistent disk volume by detaching it from its VM instance for a certain chaos duration using the disk name.

</details>

## Prerequisites

:::info

- Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16.
- Ensure that your service account has an editor access or owner access for the GCP project.
- Ensure that the target disk volume is not a boot disk of any VM instance.
- Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the GCP service account credentials in the default namespace. A sample secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  type:
  project_id:
  private_key_id:
  private_key:
  client_email:
  client_id:
  auth_uri:
  token_uri:
  auth_provider_x509_cert_url:
  client_x509_cert_url:
```

## Default Validations

:::info

- Disk volumes are attached to their respective instances.

## Experiment Examples

### Common Experiment Tuneable

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-Tuneable-for-all-experiments) to tune the common Tuneable for all the experiments.

### Detach Volumes By Names

It contains comma separated list of volume names subjected to disk loss chaos. It will detach all the disks with the given `DISK_VOLUME_NAMES` disk names and corresponding `ZONES` zone names and the `DEVICE_NAMES` device names in `GCP_PROJECT_ID` project.  It reattached the volume after waiting for the specified `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration.

`NOTE:` The `DISK_VOLUME_NAMES` contains multiple comma-separated disk names. The comma-separated zone names should be provided in the same order as disk names.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-disk-loss/gcp-disk-loss.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## details of the gcp disk
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-disk-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # comma separated list of disk volume names
        - name: DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
          value: 'disk-01,disk-02'
        # comma separated list of zone names corresponds to the DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        # it should be provided in same order of DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'zone-01,zone-02'
        # comma separated list of device names corresponds to the DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        # it should be provided in same order of DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
        - name: DEVICE_NAMES
          value: 'device-01,device-02'
        # gcp project id to which disk volume belongs
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'project-id'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Multiple Iterations Of Chaos

The multiple iterations of chaos can be tuned via setting `CHAOS_INTERVAL` ENV. Which defines the delay between each iteration of chaos.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/gcp-vm-disk-loss/chaos-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines delay between each successive iteration of the chaos
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: gcp-vm-disk-loss
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # delay between each iteration of chaos
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '15'
        # time duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
        - name: DISK_VOLUME_NAMES
          value: 'disk-01,disk-02'
        - name: ZONES
          value: 'zone-01,zone-02'
        - name: DEVICE_NAMES
          value: 'device-01,device-02'
        - name: GCP_PROJECT_ID
          value: 'project-id'
```
