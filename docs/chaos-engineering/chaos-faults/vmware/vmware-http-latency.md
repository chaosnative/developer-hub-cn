title: VMware HTTP Latency
---

## Introduction
- It injects http response latency on the service whose port is provided as TARGET_SERVICE_PORT by starting proxy server and then redirecting the traffic through the proxy server.
- It can test the application's resilience to lossy/flaky http responses.

## Prerequisites
:::info
- Ensure that Kubernetes Version >= 1.17
- Ensure that you have sufficient Vcenter access to stop and start the VM.
- Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: vcenter-secret
    namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### NOTE
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as an chaosengine ENV variable.
:::

## Default Validations
:::info
- VM should be in healthy state.

## Experiment Examples

### Common Experiment Tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-experiments) to tune the common tunables for all the experiments.

### Target Service Port

It defines the port of the targeted service that is being targeted. It can be tuned via `TARGET_SERVICE_PORT` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/target-service-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the port of the targeted service
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Proxy Port

It defines the port on which the proxy server will listen for requests. It can be tuned via `PROXY_PORT` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/proxy-port.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# provide the port for proxy server
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the port for proxy server
        - name: PROXY_PORT
          value: '8080'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Latency

It defines the latency value to be added to the http request. It can be tuned via `LATENCY` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/latency.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the latency value
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the latency value
        - name: LATENCY
          value: '2000'
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Toxicity

It defines the toxicity value to be added to the http request. It can be tuned via `TOXICITY` ENV.
Toxicity value defines the percentage of the total number of http requests to be affected.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/toxicity.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the toxicity
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # toxicity is the probability of the request to be affected
        # provide the percentage value in the range of 0-100
        # 0 means no request will be affected and 100 means all request will be affected
        - name: TOXICITY
          value: "100"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: "80"
```

### Network Interface

It defines the network interface to be used for the proxy. It can be tuned via `NETWORK_INTERFACE` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/http-latency/network-interface.yaml yaml)
```yaml
## provide the network interface for proxy
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
  - name: vmware-http-latency
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provide the network interface for proxy
        - name: NETWORK_INTERFACE
          value: "eth0"
        # provide the port of the targeted service
        - name: TARGET_SERVICE_PORT
          value: '80'
```
