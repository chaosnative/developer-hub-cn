title: VMware Service Stop
---

## Introduction

- VMware Service Stop experiment stops the target systemd services running on Linux OS based VMware VM to determine the application/service resilience.
- It helps to check the performance of the application/service running on the VMWare VMs.

:::

## Prerequisites

:::info

- Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16

### vCenter Requirements

- Ensure the connectivity of execution plane with vCenter and the hosts over 443 port.
- Ensure that Vmware tool is installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Ensure that you have sufficient vCenter permission to access hosts and VMs.
- Ensure to create a Kubernetes secret having the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. A sample secret file looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### NOTE

You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as an ChaosEngine ENV variable.

## Default Validations

:::info

- VM should be in healthy state.
- The target services should exist in the VM.

## Experiment Examples

### Common Experiment Tunables

Refer to the [common attributes](../common-tunables-for-all-experiments) to tune the common tunables for all the experiments.

### SERVICE_NAME

It contains the target service running on a particular VM

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-service-stop/vmware-service-stop.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Service Stop in the VMWare VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: vmware-service-stop
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # Name of the VM
            - name: VM_NAME
              value: 'test-vm-01'
            # Name of service
            - name: SERVICE_NAME
              value: 'nginx'
```
